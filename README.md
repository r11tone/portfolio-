# portfolio-

## Description

- I wanted to create a portfolio that i felt looked great and showcased basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- I focused more on the style of each page to make it look what i feel is clean and usable.
- This project taught me how to make a multiple page website using only HTML and CSS.

## Installation

I created 4 HTML's for 4 pages of the website. I utilized 1 CSS file for 3 of the 4 pages and a 2nd CSS file for the projects page that will later consist of Javascript.
